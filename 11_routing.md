## Issue on Documentation
https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/issues/38

#### Component
Pool Interaction, Swaps, Pool Interaction, Settle/Take/Mint

##### Describe the suggested feature and problem it solves.
Develop a swap router. With the introduction of things like Universal Router and multi-version routers (i.e. SwapRouter02)
Could be nice to include extensible abstract contracts (or libraries?) in this repo to be used in external contracts. But at least have a sound router example code in here.

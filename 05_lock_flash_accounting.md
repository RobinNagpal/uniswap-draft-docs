Pool actions can be taken by acquiring a lock on the contract and implementing the `lockAcquired` callback to then proceed with any of the following actions on the pools:

- `swap`
- `modifyPosition`
- `donate`
- `take`
- `settle`
- `mint`

Only the net balances owed to the pool (negative) or to the user (positive) are tracked throughout the duration of a lock. This is the `delta` field held in the lock state. Any number of actions can be run on the pools, as long as the deltas accumulated during the lock reach 0 by the lockâ€™s release. This lock and call style architecture gives callers maximum flexibility in integrating with the core code.


In `PoolManager` "locking" is essentially a way to ensure certain operations are coordinated and don't interfere with each other

1. **LockData Structure and Storage**:
    ```solidity
    IPoolManager.LockData public override lockData;
    mapping(address locker => mapping(Currency currency => int256 currencyDelta)) public currencyDelta;
    ```
   `lockData` is an instance of a structure `LockData` which presumably is defined in `LockDataLibrary`. This structure holds the state of current locks. The `currencyDelta` mapping keeps track of amounts due/owed by each locker for every currency.

2. **The `lock` function**:
    ```solidity
    function lock(bytes calldata data) external override returns (bytes memory result) {
        lockData.push(msg.sender);

        result = ILockCallback(msg.sender).lockAcquired(data);

        if (lockData.length == 1) {
            if (lockData.nonzeroDeltaCount != 0) revert CurrencyNotSettled();
            delete lockData;
        } else {
            lockData.pop();
        }
    }
    ```
   This function does several things:
    - First, it pushes the `msg.sender` (the caller of this function) into the `lockData`.
    - Then it invokes the `lockAcquired` callback on the caller. This presumably allows the locker to execute certain logic while holding the lock.
    - After the callback, if this is the only active lock, it checks if everything was settled (`nonzeroDeltaCount == 0`), and if so, clears the `lockData`. If there are more locks, it simply pops the last locker.

3. **Accounting for Changes**:
   There are functions like `_accountDelta` and `_accountPoolBalanceDelta` which adjust the currency deltas for lockers. These deltas represent the amounts that are owed or due because of actions taken while holding the lock.

4. **OnlyByLocker modifier**:
    ```solidity
    modifier onlyByLocker() {
        address locker = lockData.getActiveLock();
        if (msg.sender != locker) revert LockedBy(locker);
        _;
    }
    ```
   This is a function modifier that ensures a function can only be called by the current active locker (the one that has acquired the lock).

5. **Usage of `onlyByLocker`**:
   Several functions in the contract, such as `modifyPosition`, `swap`, `donate`, `take`, `mint`, and `settle`, use the `onlyByLocker` modifier. This ensures that only the entity that has currently locked the contract can modify positions, swap tokens, etc. This helps ensure operations are atomic and avoid potential race conditions.

In summary, the locking mechanism in this contract ensures that certain operations are done atomically by an entity that has acquired a lock. The entity must then make sure to settle any dues or payments before releasing the lock. This mechanism provides a way to coordinate actions and prevent potential issues arising from multiple entities trying to perform conflicting operations simultaneously.

The locking mechanism in this code allows external contracts to temporarily take exclusive control over the PoolManager to make atomic operations involving multiple state changes.

The key things to note:

1) The LockData struct tracks a queue of lockers (current callers with the lock) as well as a count of non-zero currency balances owed.
2) The lock() method acquires the lock by pushing the caller onto the queue. The caller must fully settle their balances before releasing the lock.
3) The onlyByLocker modifier checks that msg.sender is the last address in the queue.
4) Critical state-changing methods like swap(), donate(), take() etc. are guarded by the onlyByLocker modifier.
5) When the caller is done with their atomic operations, they call lock() again, which pops them off the queue and deletes the lock data if they were the last locker.
6) The lock() method returns a callback payload that the locker can use to integrate the locking mechanism into their own contract logic.
7) Lockers must carefully manage balances owed using the _accountDelta() method during their locked operations.
8) When the last lock is released, all currency balances must net to zero, otherwise it fails.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the locking mechanism:

- The LockData struct contains two fields:
   - length - tracks the number of lockers currently in the queue
   - nonzeroDeltaCount - tracks the number of non-zero currency balances owed across all lockers

- The lockData variable in PoolManager is the sentinel storage slot for the queue. It gets passed around to the LockDataLibrary functions.

- When an external contract calls lock(), it pushes the caller's address onto the end of the queue. This acquires the lock.

- The LockDataLibrary uses a mapped storage pattern - locker addresses are stored starting from a constant OFFSET slot.

- Length tracks the index of the slot for the currently last locker.

- Lockers call PoolManager methods guarded by the onlyByLocker modifier while the lock is held.

- onlyByLocker checks that msg.sender matches the last address in the queue.

- Whenever a locker adjusts balances via _accountDelta(), the nonzeroDeltaCount is updated.

- When finished, the locker calls lock() again, which pops them off the queue and clears lockData if they were the last one.

- Before releasing the last lock, nonzeroDeltaCount must be zero, meaning all balances net to zero.

- While locked, the locker has exclusive write access to make multiple state changes across deposit, withdraw, swap etc.

- The lock() method lets them integrate the locking mechanism into their own contract logic by returning a callback payload.

- This technique allows trusted contracts to atomically batch operations in a gas-efficient manner.

- The contract effectively locks itself until the caller is done, preventing reentrancy issues.

So in summary, this queue-based locking mechanism facilitates atomic cross-method operations for trusted external contracts.
